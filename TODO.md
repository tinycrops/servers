I'm imagining a workflow for a Syncthing MCP server. 
what could it be used for?

well, I just downloaded Syncthing for windows.

is anyone building a Syncthing MCP server? would it be dangerous or useless?  I like dangerous.

Imagine a zero friction onboarding that automatically downloaded and synced itself across all user devices.
